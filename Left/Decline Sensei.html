    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> but fight a worthy opponent. If you could defeat someone of great status and power, your honour and respect will be restored.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> You walk away from the sensei, with a blade in your hand, seeking a worthy opponent.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> In the darkness you spot a fierely menacing being, unlike anything you have ever witnessed. His voice deep, his tone menacing, his eys glaring.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> This man was clearly a worthy opponent. A battle with him would be legendary. However you hesitate to challenge him,&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> for you may not be able to match his might. Either fight him and reclaim your honour or go back to the sensei and accept his offer.&nbsp;</p></center>
