    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> You sprint back to the sensei. He is sitting down, meditating. You approach the Sensei. His eyes slowly open as he gracefully stands up.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> You inform him of the peculiar man you saw, and how you have changed you mind and wish to train under him. The Sensei accepts, however he tells you.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> he wont teach you how to fight, only to survive and defend. Out of curiosity, you ask why he would not teach you how to fight.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> The Sensei informs you that he a great student before you. He tells you he was a progidy. He was unlike anything the sensei had ever seen before.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> His strikes as string as a lion, his speed faster than a leapord, his sight greater than a hawk's, his mind intelligent and his reflexes sharp.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> His last student was going to be his greatest student, until one day something changed in him. His heart. The student felt that he was&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> the greatest combatant to ever exist. The Sensei was horrified by what had happened. He exiled his pupil. His apprentice refused to leave,&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> telling the Sensei that he was superior to him in every way. Both drew their blades and fought to the end. In the end, the Sensei won,&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> however overwhlemed by guilt and sorrow, he could not deal the final blow. His last student left. You tell the Sensei that you are sorry&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> for what has happened. The Sensei tell you he is sorry for you, as the ominous man you encountered was his last apprentice.&nbsp;</p></center>
