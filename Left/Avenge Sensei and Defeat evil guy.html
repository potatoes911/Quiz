    <center><p> Chapter 1.5 Ending I (The New Sensei)&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> You battle him with the blade Sensei gave you before you ran. You match your opponent well, yet he is far more experienced.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> You still persist to win the conflict, yet eventually you are disarmed. The fallen student admits you were a worthy opponent.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> He says you were good, but not good enough. He lifts his blade up. It reverberates through the air towards you. Right before he can deal.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> the finishing hit, your blade glows green. It hovers through the air and flies towards you. You catch it and continue to fight.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> The blade amplifies your abilities, making your more powerful. After a climactic fight, you eliminate the pupil. You hear a voice&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> that resembles Sensei's. It congratulates you. The voice is coming from the blade. You look at the blade and in its reflection you see.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> Sensei. Sensei explains he knew that they would not beat his apprentice together, so he gave him a blade that would absorb Sensei's soul once he died.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> Sensei also explained that without the anger and determination brought by his death, you would not have won that fight. Sensei's soul.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> now resides within the sword. He continues to guide you, until a few days later. He tells you that you have proven worthy to be the next Sensei.&nbsp;</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:25px"> Advance to Chapter 2.&nbsp;</p></center>
